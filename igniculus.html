        <p>Igniculus the firefly came into being when Aurora entered Lemuria, so everything is new to him. He was sent to help Aurora by the Lady of the Forest.

            By meeting another "firefly" like him in the Cynbel Sea, Igniculus discovers that he is an Elemental, sparks of light summoned from the ethereal plane. The "firefly" tells Igniculus that bright lights like him always forget to return to that everlasting morn, where thousands of other Elementals live.</p>
