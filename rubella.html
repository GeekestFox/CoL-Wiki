        <p>Rubella is a character who is able to join Aurora in her quest through Lemuria. She is an Aerostati jester looking for her brother. After joining, the side-quest Rubella's Plight will be added. Rubella intentionally breaks the rhyming of her own dialogue. This confuses Aurora and annoys Igniculus.</p>
